# Connect4-AI-Opponent

This program allows the user to play Connect 4 against an AI opponent.

## Background

The AI opponent in this program uses the Minimax Algorithm to select its moves. To improve the speed of calculations, the algorithm only analyzes up to
four moves into the future. This allows the AI to make quick decisions that mimic a human Connect 4 player.

## Usage

Before using, make sure to have Python 3 and Numpy installed on your computer.

To run, simply run main.py on the Python 3 interpreter.
